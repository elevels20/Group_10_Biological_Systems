 # Assignment 2

## Code
All code for this assignment can be found in [CodeAssignment3.ipynb](CodeAssignment3.ipynb). The start of this notebook is the completed BooleanModeling.ipynb notebook from the practical. After this (in the same file), the actual assignment can be found. 

To run the notebook:
1. Open the file in Jupyter Notebook.  
2. Run all cells in order, starting from the top.

## Objective
The goal of this assignment was to analyze the impact of cancer-causing mutations on cell regulatory networks through Boolean network modeling.

## Contributions
All group members contributed equally to this assignment. 

## Answers to the questions: 
1. **Which mutation is most dangerous and why? Provide quantitative evidence.**


2. **Explain the role of feedback loops (e.g., MYC → MDM2 → p53)**


3. **What are the limitations of this Boolean network model? Discuss 3 specific limitations.**
